# Graffoo4dDrawIO

[Graffoo](https://essepuntato.it/graffoo/)  (Graphical Framework for OWL Ontologies) is an open source tool that can be used to present the classes, properties and restrictions within OWL ontologies, or sub-sections of them, as clear and easy-to-understand diagrams. 

This repository provides a palette of shapes that enables the use of Graffoo in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
